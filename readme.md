# Yet Another Relog Mod
A relog mod with a name so long, you can just call it YARM for short.


## Features

* An aesthetic relog list design that follows my "perfection is bloated" design sceme.

* Clickable UI buttons that let you relog from the relog character list.

* Adventure Coin logging, which is displayed on the relog list.

## Commands
Note, if using the commands in the toolbox channel or `/8`, ignore the `!` prefix.

Additionally, you can also use "yarm" instead of "relog".
